Code used the implement the mean-field Ising Influence Maximization algorithm at both the level of a full network and at the level of blocks within a graph with block structure. Also includes code for performing Monte Carlo simulations of Ising systems on graphs used to evaulate the influence algorithms.

## Requirements

## Installation

### Applications

This module is used in (repo link TBC) for the numerical simulations in the paper:

Garrod M., and N. S. Jones. Influencing social networks without knowledge of
network micro-structure. In preparation, 2020.

### References

An earlier implementation of the mean-field Ising Inlfuence Maximisation algorithm is described in the paper: 

Lynn, Christopher, and Daniel D. Lee. "Maximizing influence in an ising network: A mean-field optimal solution." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2016. 

Our code builds upon ideas presented in this paper. The distinctions are discussed in our paper and my PhD thesis (add links to this).
